This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon bug in Tcl related to calling procedures with fewer arguments than declared. The `bug.tcl` file showcases the issue, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides a solution and demonstrates correct procedure handling.  The core problem lies in Tcl's flexible argument handling, which can mask errors when arguments are missing. The solution focuses on explicit argument checking to handle unexpected inputs.
